  <p>This is an ancient mythical sun-bird called a phoenix that represents life after death. The Phoenix bird is believed to always rise from its ashes when it dies. I believe it represents who I am for despite all the toughness that life has dealt my way, I have always risen and will always rise everytime I fall.</p>
